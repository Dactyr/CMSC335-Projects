# CMSC335-Projects

# Design:
 
This program allows a user to construct either a Two-dimensional or Three-dimensional Shape subclasses. 
The shape the user selected is given by the String 'shape', so we compare it against the possible one, and we use the needed dimensions from the array 'dimensions'.

# User's Guide:

1.	Download all files into a folder.
Navigate to folder using command line to run either the TwoDimensionalorThreeDimensionalshape programand begin interacting with the console.
`$ Javac ShapeTheme.java`
`$ Java ShapeTheme`

2.	Download the zip folder, extract folder then upload into eclipse IDE and run the program as Java application `ShapeTheme.java`.
